            <h2>OOPS CONCEPTS IN JAVA</h2>
            <P>In this page, we will learn about the basics of OOPs. Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that provides many concepts, such as inheritance, data binding, polymorphism, etc.

                Simula is considered the first object-oriented programming language. The programming paradigm where everything is represented as an object is known as a truly object-oriented programming language.
                
                Smalltalk is considered the first truly object-oriented programming language.
                
                The popular object-oriented languages are Java, C#, PHP, Python, C++, etc.
                <br>
                Object means a real-world entity such as a pen, chair, table, computer, watch, etc. Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:
            <br>
            When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object, it is known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.

            Polymorphism in Java
            Polymorphism
            If one task is performed in different ways, it is known as polymorphism. For example: to convince the customer differently, to draw something, for example, shape, triangle, rectangle, etc.
            
            In Java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.
            
            Another example can be to speak something; for example, a cat speaks meow, dog barks woof, etc.
            
            Abstraction
            Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. For example phone call, we don't know the internal processing.
